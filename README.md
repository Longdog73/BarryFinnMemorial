# Barry Finn Memorial Website

This page is to celibrate the life of Barry Finn.

Barry passed away peacefully on 5 July 2024 shortly before his 90th birthday.

Due to the way that Barry's 7 minute "funeral" was held there was a lack of closure for many people in his life.

The celebrant said "...very little is known about about his parents and his education... but was was known that he worked for many years as a manager for Big W."

This gross oversight / simplification inspired this creation of this website to which aims to show what a full life Barry lived.

Anyone who knew Barry would know that there was more to him than working for Big W. (He helped make it what it is today.)

# Technical Goals

On a technical note, I am trying to create content in markdown files and have it render into html and appear in the website.

~~I am using VS Code and the extension "Custom MD PDF" to automatically convert the markdown to html.~~

I am using VS Code and the extension "md-to-html-with-template" to  convert the markdown to html.  This requires pressing CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-P to publish to html 

Possibly a better way: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37770620/how-to-include-markdown-md-files-inside-html-files

# Barry Finn Memorial Website Project

## Overview

This project is to develop a webpage to celibrate the life of Barry Finn.

Barry passed away peacefully on 5 July 2024 shortly before his 90th birthday.

Due to the way that Barry's 7 minute "funeral" was held there was a lack of closure for many people in his life.

The celebrant said "...very little is known about about his parents and his education... but was was known that he worked for many years as a manager for Big W."

Anyone who knew Barry would know that there was far more to him than working for Big W.

This gross oversight / simplification prompted the creation of this project to which aims to show the interesting and full life Barry lived.

## Technical Goals

I am not planning on winning any awards for this website - it is about the content and getting quite a large amount of content into html easily.

I am creating the content in markdown files, where it is more humanly readable / editable and rendering into html to appear in the website.

~~I am using VS Code and the extension "Custom MD PDF" to automatically convert the markdown to html.~~

I am using VS Code and the extension "md-to-html-with-template" to  convert the markdown to html.  This requires manually pressing CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-P to publish to html. üôÅ

  <h1>Barry Finn Memorial Website</h1>
  <p>This page is to celibrate the life of Barry Finn.</p>
  <p>Barry passed away peacefully on 5 July 2024 shortly before his 90th birthday.</p>
  <p>Due to the way that Barry's 7 minute &quot;funeral&quot; was held there was a lack of closure for many people in his life.</p>
  <p>The celebrant said &quot;...very little is known about about his parents and his education... but was was known that he worked for many years as a manager for Big W.&quot;</p>
  <p>This gross oversight / simplification inspired this creation of this website to which aims to show what a full life Barry lived.</p>
  <p>Anyone who knew Barry would know that there was more to him than working for Big W. (He helped make it what it is today.)</p>
  <h1>Technical Goals</h1>
  <p>On a technical note, I am trying to create content in markdown files and have it render into html and appear in the website.</p>
  <p><s>I am using VS Code and the extension &quot;Custom MD PDF&quot; to automatically convert the markdown to html.</s></p>
  <p>I am using VS Code and the extension &quot;md-to-html-with-template&quot; to automatically (???) convert the markdown to html. (May need to press CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-P)</p>

# Teenage Years

Barry went to high school at North Sydney Boys' High where he particularly enjoyed languages especially French. He also particioated in debating and chess.

>Chess; I loved chess. Played chess for the school and won. Pretty unbeatable; cocky little bastard I was.

He played chess with two other boys against other schools

>...and we won. Used to beat the livin' stuff out of them all the time.

Barry has never been academic but has always been good with his hands and in practical situations. He inherited his father's abilities and through out his life he has always been working on some sort of project.

After being in the 2nd East Chatswood Cubs near Roseville and Mossmanm, Barry joined the Scouts in Roseville and went on to become a Patrol Leader.  He enjoyed scouts immensely, earning a lot of badges and making good friends.

He was forced to leave high school after second year (which he had repeated) because he suffered terrible headaches which made it difficult to concentrate. He was starting to feel sick again.

After Barry left school he had a job with the Postmaster-General's Department (the PMG) at Roseville delivering telegrams on a bike which was supplied by the department. He did this for two years before the family moved again.

Barry's younger brother Roger was suffering from asthma and because the Sydney climate did not agree with him, the family moved to Brisbane in January 1950. Barry had almost become troop leader int he Roseville Scouts but after moving to Brisbane he joined another scout troop and became troop leader there.

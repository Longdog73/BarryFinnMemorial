  <h1>The Navy</h1>
  <p>In October 1951, when he was seventeen and one month, Barry travelled on a series of trains to Flinders Naval Depot just south of Melbourne.</p>
  <p>He did a six month recruits' course from October 1951 to April 1952. At the end of the course Barry had to choose the field in which he was to spend his six year term.</p>
  <p>
    At first he chose to follow his father's trade, being an electrician but he did not feel that it suited him and so after a two week trial he changed to work on air radio. After settling on this trade, Barry was posted to Nowra at 'Fleet Air Arm'
    headquarters.
  </p>
  <p>Barry worked on the radios that planes carried for communications. Most planes had three but some had as many as seven.</p>
  <p>Barry was assigned to duty on an aircraft carrier which had propeller-driven aircraft and he mostly worked on the Sea Furies. These planes had a radial engine and were an improved version of the Spitfire.</p>
  <p>The first of Barry's two major trips with the Navy was to Korea in 1953. This lasted for nine months and was during the closing stages of the Korean War.</p>
  <p>Barry's ship stood off Korea and they sent in their Sea Furies with 50 lb bombs.</p>
  <p>After the cease fire, Barry was based in Japan and Hong Kong in case the peace talks broke down. He travelled both of these countries extensively.</p>
  <p>He also visited ports in Singapore, Bankok, Manilla and the Pacific Islands.</p>
  <p>Barry really enjoyed himself in the Navy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I don't think I regretted one day... I don't think I regretted one minute... I might've... I sailed into a lot of things. I learned a lot. I learned to look after myself... I learned to swim... and I thought I'd learned to dive...</p>
    <p>
      We had anchored in this lagoon because there was a storm coming up and they took safety... and we'd decided to dive from the flight deck into the ocean. Now it's 150 ft from the top of the flight deck to the ocean and a couple of guys had gone off and of
      course they were real dare devils. They'd even eat toast without butter on it; they'd do anything for a laugh. So I went off and they seemed to live so I thought I'd go off, and I looked down and ooohhh, I couldn't. I couldn't. I had butterflies and
      such, and some dirty mongeral pushed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well I went sailing throught the air, took about four months to get to the bottom, and when I did I suddenly had the sense to tuck up, cause I was going faster than a speeding bullet I tell ya. I went down so far I thought I'd never come up again, my
      lings were burstingand I xome up and all these fellas were yelling and I thought they were cheering me. So I'm trying to take a bow in the water... What they were trying to say was &quot;Shark! Shark! Ya dopey... Quick! Quick! Move!&quot; and I suddenly
      realised what they were talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well my body came out of the water like a hovercraft and I'm on the tips of my fingers and the tips of my toes, and they're all goin' round... my arms and legs are all goin' about 300 miles per hour and I'm doin' about two feet now... I just couldn't
      move properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still don't know whether the shark was chasing me but there was a shark there... I saw a big fin... I swam as fast as I could and sort of got right up on this beach which miraculously appeared. I think the fellas pushed the beach towards me more the
      fact that I actually made it swimming.

    Twice a year, for Christmas and Easter, Barry came home to Brisbane for a fortnight. These were considered excellent holiday entitlements because most people we only given one fortnight of holidays a year. By this time, his parents and brother were living
    in a house of their own in Keppera.
  </p>
  <p>During his term in the Navy, Barry developed an interesting social life. He owned a few cars and met a few women while on leave.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      ...and I used to fall in love every Saturday night at half past seven... but Val, I was still in love with her the next Saturday at half past seven so I thought there must be something... she broke it off because I got a bit uppity or something I suppose
      and I went and bought a car...
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Barry har a lot of fum with cars and remembers them fondly, particularly his 1930 Chevolet:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      ... it had a soft top and it didn't have a synchonised gearbox and you had to double declutch every time you wanted to change gears... and when you drive a car now, all you do is put your foot on the clutch once and move from gear A to gear B or whatever
      you want but with double declutching, you put your foot in, you quickly whip it into neutral, and you put your foot in again and you went from say third, cl;utched in, down to neutral, clutched in up to second and sometimes you might give it a bash
      again. So like you can imagine goin' down with this soft top down and havin' this double declutch, I had my legs and arms going everywhere like a bloody willy wag tail, honestly...
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>His next car was a black Vanguard which was an ex-taxi and cost four hundered pounds:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      ...it had a right hand gear change on the steering column if you please... and it was the time before you had indicator lights so you had to stick your hand out the window... So here you are bowlin' down the street, hand goes out the window to do a right
      hand turn, hand comes back in to change gears, out again to do ya right hand turn, back in to change down again, anybody would've thought I looked like a weevil in a packet of Weetbix I tell ya...
    </p>

  <p>The second of Barry's two major trips with the Navy was in 1956/1957, traveling to England to bring back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Melbourne_(R21)">HMAS Melbourne</a>. This was a twelve month trip.</p>
  <p>
    The HMAS Melbourne went on the earn the dubious distinction of being the only British Commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime. There were a numnber of other accidents, collisions and aircraft losses that ledw to the ship being
    known as &quot;jinxed&quot;:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The Melbourne was the one on which all the deaths occurred over the two trips we were on... and the Melbourne was the one that sliced through a shiup and sliced through two of her escort ships and I suppose... I think they attibuted two or three hundered
      deaths to the Melbourne and it was sort of a spooky ship...
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The ship that the Melboune sliced through was called the Voyager and this was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne%E2%80%93Voyager_collision">major tragedy in 1964</a> a few years after Barry's term in the Navy.</p>
  <p>Barry also served on HMAS Sydney and HMAS Vengence.</p>
  <p>Just before Barry ended his Naval career, jets were being introduced. These were much cleaner aircraft to work on as there wasn't the oil and fuel spills. Access to the engine and other equipment was also much simpler.</p>
  <p>Barry's initial enlistment had been for six years but he did not realise that the six years began when he was eighteen. His term was actually six years and eleven months. He left the Navy in September 1968.</p>

  <h1>Boyhood and School Life</h1>
  <p>In 1940, the Emden, a German Raider, stood off the coast of Nauru and fired its guns to detroy the phosphate loading equipment (coloquially known as the cantilever). This brought a halt to mining at Nauru to a halt because it could not be exported.</p>
  <p>
    With the threat of the Japanese joining the war, living on Nauru was becoming very dangerous. When Barry was six, he and his mother moved to Brisbane. Barry's father stayed on Nauru a little longer and arrived in Brisbane with the family's furniture in
    March 1941 on the last ship to get out of Nauru that was not torpedoed by the Germans.
  </p>
  <p>In Brisbane, the family lived in New Farm, boarding with a woman called Emily Pratt who was an aquaintance of a friend in Nauru.</p>
  <p>
    At this time his mother was pregnant with his brother Roger who was born in January 1941. In late 1941 the family moved to a flat in King's Cross in Sydney when his father found work at Cockatoo Docks. On December 6, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour
    and came into the war. Barry's father worked on electrical repairs on naval warships that had been damaged in conflict in the South Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>In 1943 the family moved across Sydney Harbour to a flat in Military Road, Mosman which was a better area to live than King's Cross. Barry went to Mosman primary school which was across the road.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I was fairly unhappy at school. I had all the excuses in the world, always coming home sick, always being beaten up. I started to wear glasses, that's right, I had to wear glasses when I was about eight. I wasn't too thrilled about it 'cause every kid in
      creation picked on me; used to beat the livin' crap outta me.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In 1945 the family moved again, this time to live in their own home 441 Penhurst Street Roseville. Barry attended the local primary school.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      ...I thouroghly enjoyed it. And when I'd been feigning sickness and pretending to have a stomach ache, all of a sudden I got a stomach ache which turned out to be appendicitis. And so they whipped me into hospital ... and out with the appendix and from
      there on in I just revelled in life.
    </p>

  <p>He played both cricket and rugby union in teams representing the school.</p>

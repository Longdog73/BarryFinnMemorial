  <h1>Boyhood and School Life</h1>
  <p>In 1940, the Emden, a German Raider, stood off the coast of Nauru and fired its guns to detroy the phosphate loading equipment (coloquially known as the cantilever). This brought a halt to mining at Nauru to a halt because it could not be exported.</p>
  <p>
    With the threat of the Japanese joining the war, living on Nauru was becoming very dangerous. When Barry was six, he and his mother moved to Brisbane. Barry's father stayed on Nauru a little longer and arrived in Brisbane with the family's furniture in
    March 1941 on the last ship to get out of Nauru that was not torpedoed by the Germans.
  </p>
  <p>In Brisbane, the family lived in New Farm, boarding with a woman called Emily Pratt who was an aquaintance of a friend in Nauru.</p>

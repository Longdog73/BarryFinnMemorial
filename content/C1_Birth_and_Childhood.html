  <h1>Birth and Childhood</h1>
  <p>Barry George Finn, first son of George and Emily, was born in Thornbury, Melbourne on 27th September 1934.</p>
  <p>His father, George, came from a fairly prosperous family but his mother Emily, came from a working class family. Since his parents both had grown up in Melbourne, he spent the first few years of his life surrounded by family and friends.</p>
  <p>Barry was christened in St Mary's on 16 December 1934.</p>

    In 1937, his father, who had been an electrical fitter in the Melbourne Tram System was offered a job in Nauru by the British Phosphate Commission. He accepted the job because it was similar to his previous work and the pay was much better being in such an
    isolated location.

  <p>
    He and the rest of the family packed up and moved to the small island of Nauru (21 km<sup>2</sup>) situated in the Central Pacific Ocean just south of the equator. The island is a large low plateau containing extensive deposits of phosphate rock which was
    mined by the British.

  <p>Barry enjoyed his childhood in Nauru:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I was having a good time as a three-four-five year old and riding a bike about the place and wearing hardly any clothes - just a pair of shorts and a great big hat</p>

  <p>
    The family spent three happy years on Nauru where life was certianly very casual. Nauru was a newly settled British colony. At home, white people did not do work; work was for the Chinese servants who were common place in Nauru society. Life was very
    casual but there were some formal occasions where people took tea in other people's houses waited on by the servants.

  <p>The family was very happy on Nauru and this was perhaps the most harmonous period in his parents' marriage.</p>
  <p>World War II began in 1939 and would quickly change Barry's life on Nauru.</p>

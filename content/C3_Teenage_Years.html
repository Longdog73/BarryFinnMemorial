  <h1>Teenage Years</h1>
  <p>Barry went to high school at North Sydney Boys' High where he particularly enjoyed languages especially French. He also particioated in debating and chess.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chess; I loved chess. Played chess for the school and won. Pretty unbeatable; cocky little bastard I was.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He played chess with two other boys against other schools</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>...and we won. Used to beat the livin' stuff out of them all the time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Barry has never been academic but has always been good with his hands and in practical situations. He inherited his father's abilities and through out his life he has always been working on some sort of project.</p>

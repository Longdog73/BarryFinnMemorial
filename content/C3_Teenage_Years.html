  <h1>Teenage Years</h1>
  <p>Barry went to high school at North Sydney Boys' High where he particularly enjoyed languages especially French. He also particioated in debating and chess.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chess; I loved chess. Played chess for the school and won. Pretty unbeatable; cocky little bastard I was.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He played chess with two other boys against other schools</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>...and we won. Used to beat the livin' stuff out of them all the time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Barry has never been academic but has always been good with his hands and in practical situations. He inherited his father's abilities and through out his life he has always been working on some sort of project.</p>
  <p>After being in the 2nd East Chatswood Cubs near Roseville and Mossmanm, Barry joined the Scouts in Roseville and went on to become a Patrol Leader. He enjoyed scouts immensely, earning a lot of badges and making good friends.</p>
  <p>He was forced to leave high school after second year (which he had repeated) because he suffered terrible headaches which made it difficult to concentrate. He was starting to feel sick again.</p>
  <p>After Barry left school he had a job with the Postmaster-General's Department (the PMG) at Roseville delivering telegrams on a bike which was supplied by the department. He did this for two years before the family moved again.</p>
  <p>
    Barry's younger brother Roger was suffering from asthma and because the Sydney climate did not agree with him, the family moved to Brisbane in January 1950. Barry had almost become troop leader int he Roseville Scouts but after moving to Brisbane he joined
    another scout troop and became troop leader there.
  </p>
  <p>They boarded with Emily Pratt again whom Barry and his brother called &quot;Aunty Em&quot;. Barry was not pleased with his mother's decision.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>By gee that was a time. They used to give me cold pumpkin sandwiched to take to work. Bloody people, they were really shocking. I don't know why Mum went back there.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In Brisbane, Barry was employed by Gollin &amp; Co. in Eagle Street. He worked in a warehouse collating orders of riding gear and ladies' hosery.</p>
  <p>Barry did not like this job and was not happy about the move to Brisbane at all. He had left a job he liked, friends and a family home in Sydney.</p>
  <p>The situation in the boarding house in Brisbane was trying and Barry took matters into his own hands - one day shortly after he turned seventeen, Bary joined the Navy.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One lunchtime I went down to the Naval recruiting office and signed up. We were going home on the tram and I said to Mum in front of all these people, &quot;I got a surprise for ya.&quot;</p>
    <p>She said &quot;Tell me when we get home.&quot; I said &quot;I'll tell ya now&quot;</p>
    <p>She said &quot;What?&quot;</p>
    <p>I said &quot;I joined the Navy!&quot;</p>
    <p>
      She thought I was joking... then she saw my face, I must have looked real happy or something... or more idiotic than normal. I dunno what. Then she realised I was fair dinkum. I think she burst into tears there and then and she's never forgiven me since.
